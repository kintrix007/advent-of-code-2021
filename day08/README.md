`quick.sh` is just a quick dirty script to unlock day 2, as I'm cheating and wanted to know the second part

part 2 notes:
- 2, 3, 5 -> all use 5 segments. 3 segments in common ä¸‰, the ones which only have those three in common are 2 and 5
  - 3 shares two sides with 1 unlike the others
  - 2 shares two sides with 4 unlike the others
- 0, 6, 9 -> all use 6 segments. No way to tell them apart just by themselves. \
  - 6 only shares two sides with 7 **and** only shares one side with 1, unlike the others
  - 9 shares five sides with 5 or 3 unlike 0 **and** shares four sides with 4 unlike the others
