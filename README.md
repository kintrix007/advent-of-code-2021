# Advent of Code 2021

A repo to for my solutions to AoC puzzles
My personal challenge is doing every puzzle in a different language

#### I've used these languages to solve each day:

1. Python
2. C++
3. TypeScript
4. Nim
5. Go
6. Bash

Planning to use:
  **Kotlin**, **Smalltalk**, **Scala**, **Haskell**
  *Maybe **Rust**?*
